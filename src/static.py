                        Tumors reprogram normal cellular metabolism to support uncontrolled proliferation. While some of these metabolic reprogramming strategies are common across most tumors, such as the Warburg effect, there must be diverse metabolic objectives that contribute to tumor heterogeneity.

                        We hypothesized that cancer cells have few key changes in the metabolic network, and examined frequently dysregulated metabolic genes using a multi-scale systems biology approach to determine commone features that contribute to metabolic dysregulation in tumors.
